@ Mechanical and Control Engineering, Handong Global university



â€‹		This repository covers the contents learned in the deep learning image processing course at Handong University. The main topics mainly focus on the theoretical aspects and applications of image processing and deep learning techniques (MLP, ANN, CNN) using C++ and Python. The theme of the final project is 'Implementation of an emergency braking system (AEB system)', which utilizes calibration techniques between cameras and LIDAR sensors and object recognition using YOLO V8.
